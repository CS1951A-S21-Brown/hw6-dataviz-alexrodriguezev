        <h3>Written Questions</h3>
            <p>
                1) Describe how your dashboard answers the questions presented. You don't have to address 
                every question directly, but should at a high level address the main questions. (10 points)

                    My dashboard answers the questions by providing the information in a manner that is easily and quickly understood. To 
                    answer how many titles per genre on are Netflix, I provided a bar graph that provided each genre and its corresponding
                    numnber of titles. Since the plot has a wide range, I provided buttons to filter by type, so the user could view just 
                    the movie titles and just the TV show titles. To address the question about average runtime of movies by release year, 
                    I created a scatterplot that plots release years and the average runtime of all the movies released that year. A user 
                    can hover over datapoints to see more detailed information, if the graph axes are too hard to read. Finally, to address 
                    the question about learning more about movie casts, I created a flow chart that connects all the actors that have 
                    played in movies together. To make the graph more relevant and easy to read, I included only the top actors of each
                    year as a measure of how much movies they were in in total. Moreover, this plot will also show more detailed information,
                    such as names, when hovering over data points.

                2) List 3 reasons why D3 was helpful and improved your visualization (6 points)
                    1. They have a lot of graph options, which made it easy to choose the best kind of visualization
                    2. It's relatively easy to make almost any kind of plot (especially because of "svg"s and other objects, such as "rect"s)
                    3. It's easy to make graphs easier to understand and more accesible thorugh customization, mouseover events, coloring, etc.

                3) List 3 reasons why D3 would not be the best tool for creating a visualization (6 points)
                    1. It's hard to manage fitting plots into screens
                    2. It can be tedious to translate plots across a page
                    3. It's difficult to make plots that are widely accessible (e.g. sonification)

                Accesible Data Visualization 

                4. Evaluate the accessibility of your dashboard based on the readings in the “Before you begin” section. What kinds of users 
                    might find this dashboard accessible and who might have more difficulty? What additional actions might you take to make 
                    this dashboard more accessible to all audiences? Your response should refer to at least one of the readings and be about 
                    1 paragraph.

                    The kind of users that would find the dashboard accessible may be colorblind users, because of the colors and relatively
                    large fonts and users with no visual impairments/disabilities. Additional actions I could take to make the dashboard 
                    more accesible would be to sonify the visualizations so that people who cannot see them can understand them, as Doug
                    Schepers mentions in the article 'Why Accessibility Is at the Heart of Data Visualization'. To do this, for example,
                    I could create a sound that follows the curvature of the scatterplot (my graph #2) to describe the change in average
                    movie runtimes across the years. Moreover, I could add audio that reads off the data on the bar chart and tab-functionality 
                    that would  allow a user to jump from bar to bar to access the audio, using the tab key. Although my dashboard uses 
                    different colors to make information clear, it could do more to make it accessible, especially to blind users.

                5. Reflect on the stages of your design and implementation process when you could have taken steps to make your dashboard 
                    more accessible to all audiences. What are some factors that kept you from taking these steps? (a few sentences)

                    The main factors that kept me from implementing functionality mentioned in the previous question was knowledge on 
                    how to do them and time constraints. Moreover, d3 -- that I know of -- does not have functionality that is as easy
                    to use as the rest of it to incorporate measures such as sonification easily. Had sonification, for example, been
                    featured on the main page of the site provided in the handout that includes all the chart types, I would have 
                    included sonification in the charts, time permitting.
